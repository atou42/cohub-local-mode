# Decisions

Decision models answer structured questions about text, a JSON object, or images with calibrated probabilities. The request follows the OpenRouter Decisions shape.

## API

```http
POST /api/spaces/:id/decisions
```

Requires `session.prompt.readonly` on the Space.

```ts
type CreateSpaceDecisionInput = {
  provider?: string | null;
  model?: string | null;
  state: string | Record<string, unknown> | Array<string | { type: "image_url"; image_url: string | { url: string } }>;
  questions: Record<string, DecisionQuestion>; // at most 200
};

type DecisionQuestion =
  | { type: "noul"; instructions: string }
  | { type: "choice"; instructions: string; criteria: Record<string, string> } // at least 2
  | { type: "score"; instructions: string; criteria: string[] };              // at least 2

type SpaceDecisionResult = {
  decisionId: string;
  provider: string;
  model: string;
  answers: Record<string, DecisionAnswer>;
  usage: Usage; // cost.total is the upstream-reported charge
};
```

Without `model`, selection follows catalog order like LLM completions: use the first visible model, or the first configured model if all are hidden. With `provider`, apply the same rule within that provider. An explicit model ID may select a hidden model. Put the preferred default first in the catalog; image capability does not change the order.

Images arrive as URLs. The API downloads `https` images with the safe remote fetcher, bounds them with the shared `@cohub/media` normalizer, and sends them upstream as data URLs. Caller `data:` URLs pass through unchanged. Image counts are checked against the model's `maxImages` before any upstream call.

The SDK exposes `space.decision()`; the CLI exposes `cohub decision` and `cohub spaces decision`.

## Configuration

Platform and user configuration live in `.cohub/decisions.json`. Decision models are kept out of `models.json` so they never appear in LLM pickers or `GET /api/models`. See [`examples/decisions.json`](examples/decisions.json).

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "cohub": {
      "baseUrl": "https://router.neta.art/openrouter",
      "apiKey": "PLATFORM_ENV_NAME",
      "models": [
        { "id": "openai/gpt-6-luna-decisions", "name": "Luna", "input": ["text", "image"], "maxImages": 128 },
        { "id": "jev-latest", "name": "Jev" }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `baseUrl` | Upstream base. Requests go to `<baseUrl>/api/alpha/decisions`. |
| `apiKey` | Platform-only. Resolved from a service environment variable like `models.json`. |
| `headers` | Optional extra request headers. |
| `models[].input` | `["text"]` by default. Include `"image"` for image-capable models. |
| `models[].maxImages` | Image cap for image-capable models, 1–200. Defaults to 200. |
| `models[].hidden` | Skipped for default selection while a visible model is available. |

Saving the platform Space or a user's Home Space publishes the file to Redis (`configs:decisions:v1:*`), like other config caches. A provider without `baseUrl` or `apiKey` is skipped. With no usable model the endpoint returns 503 `decisions_unavailable`, so an environment without the file has the feature off.

User configuration may only change `name` and `hidden` of platform models. Connection fields are rejected and models of other providers are ignored, because billing follows the cost the upstream reports.

## Upstream calls

Each call sends the platform key and `x-litellm-track-extra` with `user_uuid`, `cohub_space_uuid`, and `cohub_decision_id`. Transport failures, timeouts, and 5xx responses retry once; 4xx and client aborts do not.

| Upstream | Response |
| --- | --- |
| 400 | 400 `invalid_decision_request` with the upstream message |
| 401, 403, 404, 503 | 503 `decisions_unavailable`; details stay in the archive |
| Other failures | 502 `decision_failed` |

Every call is archived to `spaces/<spaceId>/decisions/<yyyy>/<mm>/<dd>/<decisionId>.json` with the caller request and each upstream attempt's status and body.

## Billing

Decisions are the one model call billed at the cost the upstream reports, not catalog prices. The catalog has no `cost` field.

1. The usage gate checks the balance before the call (`llm.decision`, fail-open like completions).
2. After success, `usage.cost` is recorded once as `generation.decision` with `operationId: decision:<decisionId>`.
3. A missing or non-positive cost skips the charge and logs a warning; the response is still returned.
4. Failed and aborted calls are not charged.
